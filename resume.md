Iâ€™m a software systems engineer focused mostly on SaaS businesses scaling their data systems and organizations.

## Experience

### [Kajabi](https://kajabi.com)
#### Staff Engineer: December 2020 - Present
I support engineers across the org with data systems governance and training (e.g. PostgreSQL, Kafka, and Redis), help unblock engineers who are stuck on complex problems, and guide and collaborate with others to resolve production issues and improve our improvement processes (e.g. postmortems, runbooks, and design documents).

#### Production Engineering Manager: July 2020 - December 2020
Improved hiring and onboarding processes for the Production Engineering team and grew the team from 2 to 7 engineers, and also managed 2 full time contractors. Acted as technical lead of a project to migrate our primary OLTP database from Heroku to AWS Aurora, and to a lesser extent, provided technical leadership for an initiative to migrate application servers from Heroku to AWS EKS.

#### Senior Site Reliability Engineer: November 2019 - July 2020
Led projects to improve observability and scaleability of primary OLTP RDMS and update outdated core dependencies such as Ruby and Rails.

### Independent Contractor
#### Software Systems Engineer: May 2019 - November 2019
Worked at a Fortune 50 company on a core systems team. This included profiling and instrumenting a Go service that linked to C++ and Rust libraries, working on C libraries and Ruby gems for dependency compatibility, and making improvements to a database client library.

### [ACS Technologies](https://www.acstechnologies.com)
#### Lead Software Engineer: January 2019 - May 2019
Led a team extracting a business domain from a monolithic .NET web application to a Go service using an eventually consistent data store.

### [Test Double](http://testdouble.com)
#### Developer: November 2016 - December 2018
Responsible for software delivery and consulting, I integrated with client teams and help improve their software delivery process while delivering well-tested software using the principles of Continuous Delivery.

- At [GoSpotCheck](http://gospotcheck.com), I worked on adding features to the existing web application as well as developing microservices to support a more sustainable architecture.
- At [Nexia Diagnostics](http://www.nexiahome.com/), I was responsible for software delivery of a distributed, real-time event processing pipeline and an associated single-page web application and API. I helped lead a re-architecture of their distributed event system so that they could scale to handle 10x their active connections while, at the same time, decreasing their infrastructure costs.
