I’m a software developer and consultant with experience in web development, distributed systems, and native mobile applications

## Experience

### [Test Double](http://testdouble.com)

#### Developer (Remote) — November 2016 - Present
Responsible for software delivery and consulting, I integrate with client teams and help improve their software delivery process while delivering well-tested software using the principles of Continuous Delivery.

- At [GoSpotCheck](http://gospotcheck.com), I work on adding features to the existing web application as well as developing microservices to support a more sustainable architecture.
- At [Nexia Diagnostics](http://www.nexiahome.com/), I was responsible for software delivery of a distributed, real-time event processing pipeline and an associated single-page web application and API. I helped lead a re-architecture of their distributed event system so that they could scale to handle 10x their active connections while, at the same time, decreasing their infrastructure costs.

### Rational, LLC

#### Consulting Software Developer (Remote) — August 2011 - January 2018

Rational was my single-person company through which I typically served small businesses and startups with web development, consultation, and in-person training.

- Lead developer for [Bestball](http://bestball.com/), for which I developed a custom PHP MVC framework that is still being used for client projects at [Fivable](http://fivable.com).
- Developed an automated order tracking and fulfillment application in Ruby for [Sallie’s Greatest Jams](http://salliesgreatest.com/) so they could handle the traffic from being on [Oprah’s Favorite Things](http://salliesgreatest.com/blogs/news/6851502-small-town-sc-herbal-fruit-jam-selected-as-one-of-oprah-s-favorite-things).
- Developed a Ruby API and Ember.js frontend for [ProAlert](http://web.archive.org/web/20160109184851/http://proalertapp.com/). They were able to receive initial incubation funding using the application I developed.

## Education

### B.S. in Computer Science, Franciscan University of Steubenville — May 2009

I focused on practical web development as much as possible, taking courses on Database Design and Processing, Information Warfare, Operations Research, and Web to Database Programming.
